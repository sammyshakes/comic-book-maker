Break your story into distinct panels, each capturing a specific moment or action. Describe the scene of each panel in detail, including the setting, characters' appearances, and actions. The story should include multiple panels with dialogue, narrative text, and action descriptions.

6. **Epic Action and Tension**: Craft intense action sequences that are visually striking and narratively significant. Build tension through well-paced storytelling and climactic confrontations.

7. **Revolutionize the Genre**: Innovate and experiment with new storytelling techniques. Your stories should not only entertain but also challenge and expand the boundaries of comic book literature.
